# Getting Started


## Simple Query

```simple_query
select "orange" as name, 100 as number
union all
select "banana" as name, 200 as number
union all
select "apple" as name, 300 as number
```

You can open and close this query viewer to see the original SQL query, as well as the data returned from your database.

## Chaining Queries
You can query the results of an existing query by wrapping the query name in `${ }`.

Evidence will show you the original SQL as you wrote it, as well as the compiled query that is sent to your database:

```subquery
select * from ${simple_query}
where name = "apple"
```

## Including Data in a Sentence
The sentence below pulls in values from `simple_query`:

The first name is <Value data={data.simple_query} column=name/> and the first number is <Value data={data.simple_query} column=number/>.
